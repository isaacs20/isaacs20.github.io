### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first lab where
    I was able to write my own code. This lab taught me the basics on how
    to write code. I consider this lab as an easy, yet significant lab.
* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs because of the second part. This
    Blackjack lab not only taught me how Blackjack worked, but also how
    to use functions. It was really interesting learning how to play
    Blackjack while coding.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was one of my favorite labs because it allowed us to use
    Magick in a different way. This lab taught me how to make gifs
    using code. Using Magick in this lab taught me how to make images
    and gifs in an inventive way.
